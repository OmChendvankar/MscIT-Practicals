Working with Docker

Step 1: Install WSL command
• Open PowerShell or Windows Command Prompt in administrator mode.
• Enter the ‘wsl’ command. WSL stands for Windows Subsystem for Linux.
• To see a list of available Linux distributions available for download through the online store, enter: ‘wsl -l -o’.
• To install Linux distributions use the command: ‘wsl --install -d <Distribution Name>’.

Step 2: Install Docker Desktop
• Download Docker Desktop using the following link:
https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
• Install Docker Desktop
• Go to command prompt, to check docker installation enter: ‘docker’
• To check version of Docker, enter the following command: ‘docker --version’

Step 3: Publishing an existing image into Docker container
• To publish an existing docker ‘hello world’ image into a docker container, use:
‘docker run -p 8080:8080 dotnetcoreservices/hello-world’
• Copy the URL from the above output and paste it in any browser. Change the IP address in the
URL to ‘127.0.0.1’.
• Also if you go to Docker Desktop → Images, you will see that the hello-world image has been
published in the container.
• To run the image in the command prompt enter: ‘curl
http://localhost:8080/will/it/blend?’.curl or ClientURL is a command line
tool that enables data exchange between a device and a server through a terminal.
